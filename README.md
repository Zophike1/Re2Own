# Re2Own-



# A Parody of the famed Pwn2Own 

This repository/project is a parody of the famed Pwn2Own contest held at the pretigous cansecwest conference every year, featuring targets that span on a wide varitey on a wide varity of platforms and host architectures such as x86,x64,arm,arm64,trustzone,etc. Re2Own is a parody of Pwn2Own since instead of being l33t and finding our bugs and exploits we reverse engineer the intial exploits and only mitigation bypasses used during that year's Pwn2Own to modify/recreate them or we just enjoy the pwnage ;>).
